# Accordion-Slider
WordPress plugin for creating Accordion Sliders. This plugin uses the Vue.js framework to display a set of images in an accordion-like slider. The back-end has two pages: See all sliders and add/edit slider. The front-end can be seen when using the shortcode:

```[as slider_id={id}]```
